# Virtual Power Plant with Multi-Dimensional Optimization and Location-Agnostic Deployment

## 2. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to the field of power system management and, more particularly, to a virtual power plant (VPP) system that integrates distributed energy resources (DERs), including computational loads and thermal/water storage systems, to provide enhanced grid flexibility, stability, and optimization.

## 3. Background of the Invention

### 3.1 Power System Flexibility

Flexibility in power systems is defined as the ability of the system to respond to and accommodate variations in generation and demand, in scale or time, without compromising power supply to end users. Variations arise from the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources (e.g., solar and wind) and the unpredictable nature of demand. Traditionally, flexibility has been provided by generation-side resources, such as peaker plants, which are often expensive and underutilized. Demand-side flexibility, using energy storage or load control, offers an alternative, but existing solutions often face limitations in scalability, cost, and controllability.

Additional context:
```
Flexibility_Requirements = {
    Power_Balance: MW/min,
    Frequency_Control: Hz deviation,
    Voltage_Support: MVAR,
    Ramp_Rate: MW/min
}
```

### 3.2 Virtual Power Plants (VPPs)

VPPs are cloud-based systems that aggregate and control DERs to mimic the behavior of a traditional power plant, providing grid services like operating reserves and ancillary services (voltage and frequency control). However, conventional VPPs are often limited by the characteristics of the connected DERs. They may lack fine-grained control, struggle to scale, and be geographically constrained by the location of existing controllable loads. They do not optimize over other resources domain, like optimizing heating or cooling loads, neither computational workloads.

Enhanced capabilities:
1. **Real-time Optimization**
   ```
   max Profit = Σ(t=1 to T){πt × Pt - C(Pt) - S(xt)}
   ```
   Where:
   - πt: Market price
   - Pt: Power output
   - C(Pt): Operating cost
   - S(xt): State transition cost

2. **Multi-domain Control**
   ```
   Control_Domains = {
     Electrical_Power: {Active_P, Reactive_Q},
     Thermal_Energy: {Heating_H, Cooling_C},
     Computation: {Processing_Load, Memory_Usage}
   }
   ```

### 3.3 Need for Improved VPPs

There is a need for a VPP system that overcomes the limitations of existing solutions. Specifically, there is a need for a VPP that is:

- **Customizable**: Able to provide a precisely tailored level of flexibility
- **Scalable**: Able to readily expand or contract its capacity
- **Location-Agnostic**: Able to be deployed where grid services are needed, independent of pre-existing controllable loads
- **Multi-Domain Optimized**: Able to optimize not only electrical power but also other resource domains, such as thermal loads and computational workloads
- **Economically Efficient**: Able to generate value from both grid services and other resource utilization (e.g., computing)

## 4. Summary of the Invention

The present invention provides a virtual power plant (VPP) system that addresses the limitations of prior art systems. The VPP system comprises:

### 4.1 Distributed Energy Resources (DERs)

1. **Computational Loads**

## 6. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### 6.1 System Architecture:

#### 6.1.1 Distributed Energy Resources (DERs):

Computational Loads: The core of the VPP's flexibility is provided by a network of computing devices capable of executing batch processing tasks. These devices can be located in data centers, distributed computing facilities, or any location with sufficient power and network connectivity. The key characteristic is that these computational tasks can be interrupted, delayed, or relocated without significantly impacting their overall completion. Examples include scientific simulations, data analysis, machine learning model training, and rendering. The power consumption of these devices is controlled by adjusting their clock speed, the number of active processing units (e.g., GPUs or CPUs), or by migrating workloads between devices.

District Heating/Cooling Systems: The VPP can integrate with district heating and/or cooling systems. These systems provide thermal energy to multiple buildings from a central plant.  The VPP can control the operation of these systems (e.g., adjusting setpoints, pump speeds) to modulate their electrical load. Thermal energy storage (e.g., hot water tanks, chilled water tanks) and water storage can be incorporated to provide additional flexibility, allowing the system to store thermal energy or water when electricity prices are low or grid conditions are favorable and release it when needed.

Optional Traditional DERs: The VPP can also incorporate traditional DERs, such as batteries, electric vehicle chargers, controllable HVAC systems, and other demand-side management resources. This allows the VPP to leverage existing infrastructure and provide a broader range of grid services.

#### 6.1.2 Energy Controller:

The Energy Controller is responsible for managing the active and reactive power flow between the VPP and the power grid.  It receives real-time measurements from power meters (voltage, current, frequency, active power, reactive power) at the point of interconnection with the grid and, optionally, at individual DER units.  The Energy Controller can implement various control strategies, including:

Droop Control: A local control loop that automatically adjusts the VPP's power output in response to deviations in grid frequency or voltage.
Model Predictive Control (MPC): A more advanced control strategy that uses a model of the VPP and the grid to predict future behavior and optimize the VPP's operation over a time horizon.
Setpoint Tracking: The Energy Controller can receive setpoints from a grid operator or a higher-level control system and adjust the VPP's output to meet those setpoints.

#### 6.1.3 Compute Load Balancer:

The Compute Load Balancer manages the flow of computational workloads to the available computing resources. It receives requests from users or applications, specifying the computational task, processing time requirements, and (optionally) a maximum price the user is willing to pay.  The Compute Load Balancer considers factors such as:

Grid Conditions: Real-time energy prices, grid congestion, and ancillary service requirements.
Computational Resource Availability: The number and type of available computing devices, their current utilization, and their location.
Task Requirements: The computational intensity of the task, its deadline, and its priority.
The Compute Load Balancer assigns workloads to specific computing devices and can dynamically adjust the allocation based on changing conditions.

#### 6.1.4 Multi-Domain Optimization Engine:

This is the central intelligence of the VPP.  It receives data from the Energy Controller, the Compute Load Balancer, power meters, and sensors associated with the district heating/cooling systems and thermal/water storage.  The optimization engine uses a mathematical model of the VPP and the grid to solve an optimization problem. The objective function can be customized based on the specific goals of the VPP operator. Examples include:

Maximize profit:

Profit = Revenue - Cost
Revenue = Revenue_compute + Revenue_ancillary
Cost = Cost_power + Cost_constraint_violation
Where:

Revenue_compute: Revenue generated from completing computational tasks.
Revenue_ancillary: Revenue generated from providing ancillary services to the grid.
Cost_power: The cost of electricity consumed by the VPP.
Cost_constraint_violation: Penalties for violating constraints (e.g., exceeding power limits, missing computational deadlines).
Minimize grid operating costs: This could involve minimizing the use of expensive peaker plants or reducing transmission congestion.

Meeting a combination of power, heating, cooling and compute targets.

The optimization engine considers various constraints, including:

Computational demand and availability.
Computational processing time requirements.
Power availability and grid limits.
Ancillary service demands.
Thermal storage capacity and temperature limits.
Water storage capacity.
The optimization engine generates control signals that are sent to the DERs, adjusting their power consumption (or generation), computational workload allocation, and thermal system operation.

#### 6.1.5 Communication Network:

A reliable communication network is essential for the operation of the VPP.  This network connects all components, enabling real-time data exchange and control signal transmission.  The network can use various communication technologies, including wired and wireless connections, and should be designed for low latency and high reliability.

        Objective: "Economics"
    }
}
```

### 6.2 Operational Modes:

#### 6.2.1 Grid Support Mode:  The VPP provides ancillary services to the grid, such as frequency regulation, voltage support, and operating reserves.  The Energy Controller adjusts the active and reactive power output of the VPP based on grid conditions and signals from the grid operator.  The Compute Load Balancer prioritizes computational tasks that can be completed within the constraints imposed by the grid's needs.

#### 6.2.2 Stranded Energy Utilization Mode:  The VPP is deployed in a location with stranded renewable energy (e.g., a wind farm with limited transmission capacity). The VPP consumes the excess energy, converting it into useful computational output.

#### 6.2.3 Load Shedding Mode:  The VPP acts as a highly responsive load shedder, rapidly reducing its power consumption in response to a grid emergency.  This can be achieved by interrupting or delaying batch computational tasks and/or by adjusting the operation of the district heating/cooling systems.

#### 6.2.4 Combined Heat, Power, Water and Compute Mode: The VPP utilizes its capability to simultaneously dispatch power, heating, cooling, and computation tasks to optimize the operation over multi domains.

## 8. ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION (Enhanced and Elaborated)

The present invention demonstrably surpasses conventional virtual power plants and existing grid flexibility solutions by offering a unique combination of capabilities and benefits. The advantages detailed below underscore the non-obviousness and significant practical utility of this innovative VPP system.

Enhanced Flexibility and Responsiveness:  The integration of batch computational loads as a dynamically controllable Distributed Energy Resource (DER) fundamentally enhances the VPP's flexibility. Computational loads offer an unprecedented degree of scalability and controllability on the demand side. This allows the VPP to react swiftly and precisely to fluctuations in grid frequency, voltage, and overall system conditions, providing rapid response capabilities unmatched by traditional demand response mechanisms.  Moreover, the holistic optimization encompassing power, computation, heating, and cooling creates a synergistic flexibility spectrum unavailable in single-domain VPP implementations.

Location Agnostic and Versatile Deployment: Unlike conventional VPPs that rely on geographically constrained controllable loads or specific infrastructure, this invention can be deployed wherever sufficient power supply and network connectivity are available. This location agnosticism is especially advantageous in regions with abundant stranded renewable energy resources, areas with limited transmission infrastructure, or remote locations requiring robust grid support.  The VPP's adaptability broadens its applicability across diverse geographical and infrastructural settings.

Expanded P-Q Capability and Grid Support Range: The incorporation of reactive power control, coupled with the precise active power modulation of computational loads, dramatically expands the VPP's operating range within the P-Q capability curve. This enhanced capability enables the VPP to provide a more comprehensive suite of ancillary services, including advanced voltage regulation and reactive power compensation, significantly improving grid stability and power quality beyond the reach of conventional VPPs.

Dual Economic Value Stream and Improved Viability: The VPP architecture generates economic value from two distinct but synergistic revenue streams: (1) compensation for providing essential grid services, and (2) the inherent value derived from completing computational tasks. This dual revenue model substantially improves the economic viability and investment attractiveness of the system. Optimized multi-domain operation ensures that the VPP maximizes its economic return by intelligently balancing grid service provision with computational workload execution, adapting to dynamic market conditions and operational needs.

Enhanced Grid Stability, Reliability, and Resilience: By providing critical ancillary services such as frequency regulation, voltage support, and operating reserves, the VPP actively enhances grid stability and operational reliability. Furthermore, its capability to act as a responsive load shedder during emergency conditions significantly reduces the risk of widespread blackouts and strengthens overall grid resilience against unforeseen events and disturbances.

Effective Utilization of Stranded and Wasted Energy:  The VPP offers a practical and economically sound mechanism for converting otherwise stranded or wasted energy, such as curtailed renewable energy generation during periods of low demand or transmission constraints, into valuable computational output. This capability not only reduces energy waste but also directly improves the economic performance and environmental footprint of renewable energy installations by providing a flexible demand sink.

Comprehensive Multi-Domain Optimization for System Efficiency:  The VPP's core strength lies in its integrated multi-domain optimization engine, which holistically manages electrical power, computational resources, and thermal energy assets. By optimizing across these interconnected domains, the VPP achieves a significantly higher level of overall system efficiency compared to systems that optimize only within a single domain. This integrated approach unlocks synergistic benefits and maximizes the utilization of all available resources, leading to superior performance and operational economy.
