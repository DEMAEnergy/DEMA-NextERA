# GridFlowManager - Virtual Power Plant Control System

## Overview
GridFlowManager is a comprehensive React-based application suite designed to simulate and visualize Virtual Power Plant (VPP) operations. This early version serves as a foundation for developing an integrated VPP control and monitoring system.

## Application Components

### 1. Grid Control Interface
The main VPP management interface providing:
- Real-time grid monitoring
- Component-level control
- System status visualization
- Interactive node management

### 2. Load Profile Analyzer
Dedicated application for load profile analysis and management:
- Historical load data visualization
- Load pattern analysis
- Demand forecasting
- Consumer behavior insights
- Peak load identification
- Load shifting simulations

### 3. VPP Diagram Generator
Interactive tool for VPP system visualization:
- Dynamic system architecture diagrams
- Component relationship mapping
- Power flow visualization
- Real-time status indicators
- System topology management
- Interactive editing capabilities

## Current Implementation Status

This is an early simulation version that demonstrates core VPP management concepts. The applications currently focus on:

1. Visual representation of grid components
2. Basic control interfaces
3. Real-time monitoring simulations
4. System architecture visualization
5. Load profile analysis
6. VPP system diagramming
