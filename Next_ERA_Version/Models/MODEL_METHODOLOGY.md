# Virtual Power Plant (VPP) Model Methodology

## Overview

This document describes the methodology used for modeling different components in our Virtual Power Plant (VPP) system. The modeling approach is designed to be comprehensive, scalable, and adaptable to various use cases while maintaining consistency across different resource types.

## Model Architecture

### 1. Hierarchical Structure

The model system follows a hierarchical structure with three layers:

```
BaseModel (Abstract)
├── BaseLoad
│   ├── HVAC
│   ├── Motors
│   ├── IT Loads (Future)
│   └── Appliances (Future)
├── BaseSource
│   ├── PV Systems
│   ├── Wind Turbines
│   └── Generators (Future)
└── BaseStorage
    ├── Batteries
    └── Thermal Storage
```

This hierarchy ensures:
- Consistent interface across all resources
